CompStatsPython

What is CompStatsPython? Well this is a collection of statistics routines. Yes, I'm very aware of SciPy, SciKit and others, but I wanted to do my own to support a book I'm writing. In case you're curious, I released SalStat, a Python-based statistics application back in the early 2000s so I'm not exactly new either.

Anyway, this is all open source code, probably BSD or LGPL. I've not decided which just yet but just so you know, it is definitely NOT public domain. 

Included in all these routines are unit tests with results from R and PSPP for veracity. The aim is to make 2 things:

1) A large module of statistics programs that are easier to access than most;
2) A book (probably freely distributable) that explains the code and gives examples of how to use the routines during actual analysis. 

Let me know of any problems you get.

Have fun!
